# GPU-Fluid-Simulation

GPU based Real Time Fluid Simulation Program written in WebGL using GLSL to perform calculations on GPU.

Based on GPU Gems Chapter "Fast Fluid Dynamics Simulation on the GPU" by _Mark J. Harris_. [link](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/books/HTML/gpugems/gpugems_ch38.html)

Note: In case there are frame drops in the simulation, browser window can be zoomed in to 200% for better performance, further updates will be focused on increasing the performance. Enable Hardware Acceleration to use onboard graphics if having issues running the simulation.
